## Lessons Learned

This was one of the projects with a lot of visual components and great UI so I had to focus on making it look great and also make it performant enough.


## Optimizations

I used getStaticProps and getStaticPaths for SSG and Dynamic SSG so that the website has better FCP and I also optimised images and svgs .


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
